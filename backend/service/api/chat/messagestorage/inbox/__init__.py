# This query joins the gating rules (which fields a viewer may see, and which
# box the conversation belongs in) against the viewer's `inbox` rows so one
# websocket response carries complete conversations.
#
# `entry_predicate` narrows the viewer's `inbox` rows: empty for the whole-inbox
# snapshot, or an equality on `remote_bare_jid` (the primary key's second
# column) for a single conversation. The predicate is kept a plain equality --
# rather than an `%(x)s IS NULL OR ...` that serves both -- so the single-entry
# query gets an index scan on `inbox_pkey` even under a generic plan, which a
# parameterised `IS NULL` branch would defeat.
#
# `matches_search_filters` says whether an intro's sender passes the viewer's
# search filters, so clients can sort and flag intros from outside them. The
# predicates mirror `Q_UNCACHED_SEARCH_2` in `search.sql` (kept in sync by
# hand; each notes the other, and `test_init` here fails when a preference
# table is consulted by one query and not the other), except those that can't
# apply to an intro: the
# sender's own gender preference and `hide_me_from_strangers` (the sender
# chose to message the viewer), skipped/messaged gating (the inbox `location`
# rules already handle those), and platform verification requirements (not a
# viewer-chosen filter). Searching within a club also deliberately doesn't
# count: it scopes a search, but an intro from outside the club isn't the
# kind of mismatch this flag is for. Non-intro conversations are always TRUE.
